# Student_Registration_Web_Component_with_JSF-Ajax_Features

A Student Registration component for websites using JSF, MVC model, AJAX, and prime faces. User UI implements prime-faces to communicate data from the view to the control and model.
Data-table used to display data entered in each form after each submission.

Once a form is submitted the input data is added to a Java arrayList. Using a managed bean the data is then displayed in the datatable for the user to see all current entries.
The datatable automatically updates after each entry, the form is refreshed and ready for the next student entry.

This web component implements ajax features to allow users of the application to select datatable rows and edit them in the html form. These changes are then refelected across
the datatable for the user to see.
